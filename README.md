## Project Description

In 2011, a Harvard student, Michael Luca, did an [economic research study](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=41233) on the impact of online consumer reviews, especially reviews from Yelp.com, on restaurant demand. Luca analyzed reviews from Yelp.com along with restaurant data from the Washington State Department of Revenue. In his findings, Luca noted a causation that our group found shockingly interesting. He mentioned, “a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue”. This shows an apparent correlation between Yelp online reviews and consumer demand. In addition, Luca went on to state that, “[this] effect is driven by independent restaurants; ratings do not affect restaurants with chain affiliation”. His second findings demonstrate a strong impact of Yelp reviews on small business owners. With this, it led us to ask ourselves, is the public aware of an unintentional bias that Yelp has put among consumers and restaurants? Our group is interested in exploring the underlying social impact of Yelp reviews on restaurants in Seattle. By further validating Yelp’s social impact, we would be able to yield other demographic factors, such as median household income in various Seattle neighborhoods, crime rate, and etc., to uncover the causation within these correlations done by Michael Luca. With the social impact of Yelp restaurant reviews, how can the Seattle OED correct the public bias of restaurants in Seattle neighborhoods?    

The goal of our project is to inform the Seattle Office of Economic Development city officials about the social impact of Yelp reviews on restaurants in Seattle neighborhoods. We are From our goal, we are trying to uncover different issues around this. Specifically, we ask, with the social impact of Yelp restaurants in Seattle neighborhoods? With our decision, what we are trying to inform to the Office of Economic Development is to change how they decide to allocate their public fundings. With the information we have, we hope to be able to change allocations of their fundings to improve and increase security quality of neighborhoods with potentially higher crime rates, Improving community parks and centers for families, cleaner and safer streets which will help to improve the community in a variety of ways, like expanding bike lanes and filling dangerous potholes and such. One of the problems we have assumed to be a risk and trying to find the legitimacy of is that there could be a possible correlation between neighborhood crime rate towards biased ratings and reviews to less affluent areas. We chose to base our decision context around OED city officials in order to raise awareness on the issues of economic disparity among less funded community along different census tracts. With this, it will provide an opportunity for business owners to be more successful without the social impact of Yelp bias. 

The Seattle Office of Economic Development will be the one making the decision if or if not they want to (1) allocate public fundings to neighborhoods to improve community’s standards, and (2) where those public fundings will be going to. Our goal is to inform them about how the social influence of Yelp can impact the success of a restaurant and the OED will be the one to make the decisions if they need to take initiative to improve local or small restaurants.

We’ll be using data from a variety of sources in order support our research decision. We’ll be working with the U.S Census tract data through the data.gov page and narrowing it down to the Seattle area. The data we’ll be collecting is the latest census data taken in 2010 in order to get census tract boundaries and median household income to compare with the yelp data we will obtain. We’ll also be using the seattle.gov data which uses the U.S. census data of 2014 and CoStar data to find data on retail rent and compare that with both the median household income and yelp data.
